    <description>vmPing (Install)
==============
**vmPing** in an extended fork of [Appnor's WinMTR](http://winmtr.net/) ([sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/winmtr/)) with IPv6 support and other different enhancements and bug fixes</description>
    <summary>WinMTR is a Windows application which combines the functionality of the traceroute and ping utilities in a single network diagnostic tool.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>-------------------
- Fix: Force software rendering. This should fix high GPU usage on some video cards. 6d39400
- Fix: Loading a favorite on startup was not using the column count for the favorite. 619d722
- Fix: Scroll indicator icon would unnecessarily display when the window was resized to small dimensions. c412495
- The position and size of the status history window is now remembered rather than resetting each time it's opened. d411095
- Switch to using SnapToDevicePixels on the main window. Previously, the pixel width for the black borders between probes would sometimes vary when the window was resized. The borders should now always be consistent. 45b23de
- Removed gaps when hovering mouse between menu buttons (Add Host, Columns, Start/Stop All). Removed gap from right edge of main menu button. 6f51eb7
- Some of the menu headers have been renamed on the options screen. 531abb1</releaseNotes>
